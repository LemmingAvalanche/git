* Troubleshooting segv still
[2024-02-07 on.]

This also fails:

#+begin_src
./git-format-patch --no-cover-letter --header-cmd=./test-cmd 'HEAD^{/★meta: base}'..@
#+end_src

=--no-cover-letter=

I was wondering if the cover letter was the culprit…? Anyway. It looks
like I get to process all my patches. Because it prints the patch name
of the last commit (currently) before dying:

#+begin_src
0038-NOTE-Smooth.patch
#+end_src

So does it die when cleaning up?

Sent it to my own email and the command-headers survive transit.
